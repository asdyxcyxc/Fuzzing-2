## JPEG Mutation

This folder is for the series of fuzzing programs discussed here: https://h0mbre.github.io/Fuzzing-Like-A-Caveman/ and https://h0mbre.github.io/Fuzzing-Like-a-Caveman-2/.

The C fuzzer doesn't have the 'magic ints' mutation method, I just wanted to try and bit flip faster for fun.
